mantis-custom-category
======================

Probably not of public interest. This plugin adds some columns which translates certain bug data
into a bug category, specifically for the company I work for. However, you could add your own plugin columns
using data specifically for your company.

Or, you could fork this and turn this into a real custom category plugin, allowing the end-user to use
conditional statements using available bug data and transforming that into derived categories :)
